    mc "I came to after a sleepless blur, stretched across two chairs stitched together, my curled up body covered with someone’s coat."
    "What roused me wasn’t morning light, but the restless shuffle of adults, rising with heavy heads and clouded eyes."
    "The church fête waits for tomorrow, yet the alcohol and laughter started spilling well from early Friday afternoon."

    mc "I pushed myself up, rubbing the sleep out of my eyes, and started fiddling with the knobs."

    "I pressed every button I could find, then, in my childish frustration, gave the thing a sharp smack."
    "My uncle stared at me for a moment before he joined in, slapping it around like he was tenderizing a piece of meat after a fight with auntie."
    
    "I barely noticed my mom setting two cups of chicory coffee on the low table, the steam curling into the stale air."

    mom "Strange… Maybe it’s something to do with the weather. Spare the poor thing, will you?"

    mc "She smiled faintly and turned to the radio, spinning the dial in search of the right frequency. Static came in waves, roaring, hissing, screaming. For a moment I thought I could make out words, but they dissolved back into the noise akin of scrunching paper. And then I became happy, my brain suddenly able to truly comprehend what it was hearing."
    
    "At the same time, the TV graced us with its tepid glow."

    tv "--day, I address you as a soldier and as the head of the Polish government. I address you on matters of the highest importance."

    "Our homeland has found itself on the edge of an abyss. The legacy of many generations, the Polish home raised from the ashes, is falling into ruin."

    "The structures of the state have ceased to function. The challenge before us is beyond anyone’s ability to resolve."

    "In six days, the world as we know it will come to an end. This is not a crisis we can avert. It is an event we must meet with composure."

    "What matters now is dignity, order, and solidarity. Official announcements will be made each morning and evening. You are advised to stay informed, but not to spread rumors."

    "We recognise that not everyone will want to act. That is acceptable. 
    If your choice is to close your blinds and sleep through the last week, it is as valid as any other."

    "There will be no official judgment."

    mc "The announcement drags on, covering bureaucracy, patriotism, and outlining how things are expected to proceed from this point onward. I listen until my coffee goes cold. The world is supposed to tilt. My hands know how to do the tilt. They practice it on small things; closing windows, turning keys. But nothing tilts. The town keeps its shape. It annoys me to no end."

    "My uncle stares at me for a moment before shrugging."

    "Guess I’d better grab my things. Who knows if I’ll be able to get past the town’s borders if I sit around on my arse any longer, har har! Take care, will ya?"

    "He pulled on his pants while Mom handed him his coat, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek. At the doorstep they lingered, trading goodbyes and half-sentences for far longer than needed, one foot out, one foot in, the same as always. Behind them, the radio droned on, the announcement looping again and again as the TV played obnoxious static."
